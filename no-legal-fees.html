  <h1>No Legal Fees – Only Results</h1>
  <p>
    No legal fees charged to clients.<br><br>
    Because counterfeit sales platforms are numerous, budgeting legal fees for every case is unrealistic.
    We cover all litigation costs and only seek compensation from counterfeiters. Even if compensation isn’t received,
    we bear the risk — never the client.
  </p>
