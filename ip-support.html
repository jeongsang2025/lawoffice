      <strong>JeongSang Law Office</strong> has over a decade of experience exclusively focusing on intellectual property rights enforcement,
      particularly in the area of trademark and copyright protection. We have successfully shut down hundreds of counterfeit sales platforms operating in Korea.

    <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.7; color: #333; margin-top: 20px;">
      We also bring over 25 years of expertise in major copyright litigation, including representation in high-profile cases involving software giants

      intellectual property infringements.

    <h3 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 600; color: #083c6c; margin-top: 40px;">Our Core Enforcement Strategy</h3>
    <ul style="font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
      <li>Full-cycle service: investigation, undercover purchases, legal enforcement (warning → negotiation → lawsuit).</li>
      <li>Local verification of infringing goods through mystery shoppers or client HQ comparison.</li>
      <li>We primarily pursue civil litigation for monetary damages, as Korean police deprioritize IP-related crimes.</li>
      <li>Strategic judgment is used to determine whether to escalate from warnings to legal action.</li>
      <li>Most enforcement efforts are carried out by our highly trained internal investigators—not outsourced.</li>
    </ul>
