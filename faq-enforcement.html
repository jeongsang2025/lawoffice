    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Is it possible for the headquarters to handle this directly?</h2>
    <p>The headquarters can only report to platforms but cannot conduct legal action. Only licensed Korean attorneys can represent clients in Korean courts.</p>

    <h2>How can counterfeit products be identified?</h2>
    <p>We check product pricing, condition, customer reviews, and conduct mystery shopping. If distinction is difficult, we purchase the product and deliver it to the brand owner for verification.</p>

    <h2>After searching for the brand, no counterfeits seem visible. Why?</h2>
    <p>Counterfeit sellers have become more sophisticated. Due to increased monitoring by open markets, they now sell without displaying logos or brand names. However, upon purchase, counterfeit goods with logos are often delivered.</p>

    <h2>Can't we just report them to open market platforms?</h2>
    <p>Reporting results only in temporary removal. Sellers often reopen under different accounts or create new sites. Legal penalties are crucial for permanent deterrence.</p>

    <h2>Would blocking a few websites as a test be enough?</h2>
    <p>No. Counterfeiters make significant profits and will not voluntarily stop. Only by targeting all sellers simultaneously can we eradicate counterfeit sales quickly.</p>

    <h2>How is the enforcement process carried out?</h2>
    <p>The process is simple. Once we receive a power of attorney, we immediately begin investigation, evidence collection, and litigation. Based on our experience, most counterfeit websites are shut down within 6 months to 1 year.</p>
