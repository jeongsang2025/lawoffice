    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  </header>
  <section>
    <div class="question">
      <h3>How do you determine whether a product is counterfeit?</h3>
      <p>We consider pricing, condition, reviews, and direct inquiries. When uncertain, we buy and verify through official brand offices.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      <h3>Do you pursue civil lawsuits in addition to criminal charges?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Civil suits offer faster resolution and penalties. Korean police deprioritize IP crimes, and criminal sanctions alone are often too weak.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      <h3>What types of clients do you serve?</h3>
      <p>We represent global companies from the US, Canada, Japan, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Switzerland, and more.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      <h3>Are you using AI in your investigations?</h3>
      <p>We are preparing for AI integration but currently rely on trained staff for investigation and evidence collection.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      <h3>What are some common tactics used by counterfeiters?</h3>
      <p>They mimic real prices and hide logos. Detection requires legal and investigative expertise.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      <h3>How do you ensure clients are not financially burdened?</h3>
      <p>We cover litigation costs and only claim fees from counterfeiters. Clients owe nothing unless we win compensation.</p>
